# Correct sentence

## 一、题目描述

**要求**：完成函数correct_sentence(str)，输入一个字符串，返回一个以大写字母开头，以“.”结尾的字符串副本

**输入**：字符串

**输出**：字符串

**示例**：

```python
correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
```

> **解题提示**：
>
> 1. 可以字符串相加；
> 2. 可以用lambda表达式:
>
> ```python
> correct_sentence = lambda t: t[0].upper() + t[1:] + '.'*(t[-1] != '.')
> ```
>


## 二、解题示例
### 1. 字符串相加
```python
def correct_sentence(text: str) -> str:
    """
        returns a corrected sentence which starts with a capital letter
        and ends with a dot.
    """
    # your code here
    if text[-1] == '.':
        tmp = ''
    else:
        tmp = '.'
    return text[0].upper() + text[1:]+tmp



if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Example:")
    print(correct_sentence("greetings, friends"))

    # These "asserts" are used for self-checking and not for an auto-testing
    assert correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
    assert correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
    assert correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
    assert correct_sentence("hi") == "Hi."
    assert correct_sentence("welcome to New York") == "Welcome to New York."

    print("Coding complete!")
```

### 2. lambda
```python
def correct_sentence(text: str) -> str:
    """
        returns a corrected sentence which starts with a capital letter
        and ends with a dot.
    """
    # your code here
    return lambda t: t[0].upper() + t[1:] + '.'*(t[-1] != '.')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Example:")
    print(correct_sentence("greetings, friends"))

    # These "asserts" are used for self-checking and not for an auto-testing
    assert correct_sentence("greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
    assert correct_sentence("Greetings, friends") == "Greetings, friends."
    assert correct_sentence("Greetings, friends.") == "Greetings, friends."
    assert correct_sentence("hi") == "Hi."
    assert correct_sentence("welcome to New York") == "Welcome to New York."

    print("Coding complete!")
```
